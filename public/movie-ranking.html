<h4>Review:</h4>
<p>The movie skillfully addresses the sensitive topic of racial segregation in the 1960s through the unlikely friendship between Dr. Don Shirley and Tony Lip. Mahershala Ali's portrayal of Dr. Shirley and Viggo Mortensen's depiction of Tony Lip are exceptional, and their on-screen chemistry brings the story to life. The film's heartwarming message of unity and the pursuit of common ground, along with its humor and music, make it a truly captivating and memorable cinematic experience.</p>
